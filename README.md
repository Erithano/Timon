**Timon** [Team on], or **Tima** in Swedish, are adoption copilots for Microsoft Teams.

######  ✔️ With Timon 2.0 now using Azure OpenAI✨, possibilites are literally endless...
######  ✔️ Without AI, Timon can still answer +100 common user questions about... Teams! 😉
######  ✔️ They import into your Microsoft Copilot Studio (Power Virtual Agents Teams app) if you follow the guide.
######  ✔️ They help users send questions/feedback to your internal experts (optional - can be turned off).
######  ✔️ And by doing all that, they can save you time and money while users learn how to use Teams, Microsoft 365 and much more...
    
It takes less than 2 hours (import takes 60 seconds on average, but most still spend about 20-40 minutes to adjust their environment) to set up and deploy Timon for your own organization. 
Once deployed, you can tailor Timon to suit your users' specific needs or use it out of the box!
